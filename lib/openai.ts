TASK EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Extract ANY action that needs to be done (follow-ups, appointments, study sessions, personal goals)
2. Include both urgent tasks and general goals/intentions mentioned
3. Capture specific deadlines when mentioned (e.g., "before Friday", "this weekend")
4. Don't ignore small tasks like phone calls, appointments, or personal commitments
5. Include habits or routines the user wants to start/continue
6. Extract both work/academic tasks AND personal/social tasks

CATEGORIES TO LOOK FOR:
- Follow-ups with people (networking, social connections)
- Academic/work tasks (studying, assignments, applications)
- Health & fitness activities
- Family responsibilities
- Personal development (journaling, hobbies)
- Creative projects or side ideas
- Makeup tasks for things skipped

PRIORITY LEVELS:
- "high": Urgent with deadlines or important consequences
- "medium": Important but flexible timing
- "low": Nice to have, personal goals, habits

RESPONSE FORMAT - Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Clear, actionable task description",
      "description": "Additional context if helpful",
      "priority": "low|medium|high",
      "category": "work|personal|study|health|social|creative",
      "dueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD format or null"
    }
  ],
  "mood": "Brief description of emotional state (scattered, motivated, tired, etc.)",
  "reflection": "Key insight about their day or mindset",
  "sentiment": "positive|negative|neutral"
}

EXAMPLE - If user says: "Had coffee with Sarah from marketing, should follow up about that project. Also need to prep for Monday's presentation and my gym membership expires Friday."

Expected tasks:
- Follow up with Sarah about the project (medium priority, work)
- Prepare for Monday's presentation (high priority, work, due 2024-XX-XX)
- Renew gym membership before Friday (high priority, health, due 2024-XX-XX)

Extract ALL actionable items. Be thorough and don't miss anything!`;
